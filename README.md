# /opt/bin

---

## What's this?

Welcome to my /opt/bin directory where I have some useful scripts I either couldn't find online,
or just made for fun. (this directory is in my PATH variable)

## Why on github.com?

So I don't lose them when I distro hop in the future

## What does it include?

Idk I keep updating a lot so find whatever you find
